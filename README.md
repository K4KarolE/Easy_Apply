# Easy Apply
- Have you ever been annoyed by the repetitive nature of the job applications?
    - Most of the time the data extraction from a resume(if there is an option at all) do not work properly, so you need to select and copy-paste the same data from your CV over and over again every time you apply for a new role
- `Easy Apply` let you add the information into your clipboard by just clicking on a button of the selected field
    - The first row of the `Contacts` automatically added to the clipboard at the start of the app
- Marketing line: Let`s make the job applications great again!
- Marketing retrospective: Sorry!
